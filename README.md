# Zup3x Sigma (0.3)

Zup3x is meant to replace Hop3x Student. This tool could avoid lot of pain in using Hop3x.
Hop3x is mandatory for L3 SPI students at Le Maine University of Le Mans (FR.). This tool allow you to
use your modern and shiny IDE and keep your project up to date in Hop3x.
This tool is still under testing, use it at your own risk.

Zup3x v0.3 aka. Sigma is the first RC. Multiplatform bot assistant for Hop3x.

**Functions**
  - Create, edit files/projects in Hop3x like a human being.
  - Compiles and tests with Hop3x and send result(s) through email.
  - Get report by email when something is done.
  - Get remote git and update them in Hop3x

**Forbidden**

    To use this tool without proper sources, don't steal sources for your own sake..
    Don't try to fool your teacher with foreign sources, exams will eventually take off your mask!

**Why does Zup3x comes to exist ?**

> Hop3x is a half failure, is was meant to ?improve student
> code learning?, but for now it does improve teacher life. (And it's good for them of course)
> It's not enough stable, it cannot replace modern IDE and it crash too much! (Because of Java.. And code, of course!)
> This is why I intended to create this tool.
> The student/client part of Hop3x is not the answer of how to improve code learning
> My answer is that Hop3x server side must stand as it is, but Hop3x student should be a plugin/deamon process.
> My position can be debated of course.
> Hop3x could have a future, but not like this, for now.

### Q&A

- I'm using AZERTY keyboard and it seems to write like he recognize QWERTY one, why ?
	- pyautogui does not support azerty layout for now, but I have fixed this issue on my own. Check my pyautogui repository. Or change your keyboard layout to QWERTY!
	- Or install my pyautogui patched version.

**Backup solution**
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Ousret/pyautogui.git
$ cd pyautogui/
$ python setup.py install
```

- Something wrong!! Help me.. please ?
	- Open issue, I'll do my best when available.

	- https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en

- How do I stop Zup3x when I'm outside ?
	- Send you a email containing the word "STOP", then if you want to re-activate it later, send "OK". Not in the subject message, place it in email body.

- Can I use other provider than Bitbucket and GMail ?
	- Yes! Change the code accordingly to your needs, itâ€™s not that hard. Try it!
