Projet Zup3x (Python)
=========

Tool under MIT license, for educational purpose only. (And fair use)
This project is meant for very limited amount of people. (Student at Maine University of Le Mans, FR.)

This tool was originally created to avoid suffering when coding with Hop3x. (No offense)
Some student have to use Hop3x in order to be tracked in their current project and being rated.

This tool allow you to use modern/shiny IDE and still update your work on Hop3x like a human being!
You can schedule for fake update to keep your privacy safe from admin.

Don't do anything stupid with this tool. There is high chance that hop3x would be updated to avoid Zup3x from their network.
If so, please fork this project and find another way to Zup3x!

THIS PROGRAM IS STILL UNDER TESTING, RUN IT AT YOUR OWN RISKS!
